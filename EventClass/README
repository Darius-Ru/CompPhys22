In the EventTest code, a TFile is created with a TTree. The code only makes one event with 50 tracks. The tracks are just the system with the information
of the three particles. The information of each track can then be accessed to do the analysis.

I've been having trouble getting the classes to work in the ROOT interpreter. They work fine when compiled with the MakeFile through g++, but whenever I try
to compile the ParticleSystem class in the ROOT interpreter, I get errors. Because of this, the analysis may have to be done in a .cpp file instead of a .C
file.
