I created a ParticleSystem class that stores the lambda, proton, and pion as a system. Then the member function ParticleDecay can be used to apply the MC
simulation created by Daniel. The DecayTest code shows this working. I did not set the seed in the code, so it may bring up the same result if it is used
multiple times. If it does, the seed just needs to be set with time(NULL).

The MakeFile will make the DecayTest executable and put it into the bin directory. All the source code must go into the src directory.
