I created a ParticleSystem class that stores the lambda, proton, and pion as a system. Then the member function ParticleDecay can be used to apply the MC
simulation created by Daniel. The DecayTest code shows this working. I did not set the seed in the code, so it may bring up the same result if it is used
multiple times. If it does, the seed just needs to be set with time(NULL).

The MakeFile will make the DecayTest executable and put it into the bin directory. All the source code must go into the src directory.

The print function is used shows the lorentz vector and name of the particle. It will write the lorentz vector as (x,y,z,t) = (...), but this is the momen-
tum four vector. I used the TLorentzVector print function for my print function, so thats why its the way it is. It also prints a (p,eta,phi,E) four vector
but I'm not sure if that applies to the way I implemented the Lorentz vector.

The particle angles and energy can also be accessed after applying the PartileDecay function.
